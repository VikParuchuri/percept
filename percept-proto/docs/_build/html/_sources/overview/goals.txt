Goals of Percept
===============================================

Percept is a modular, extensible framework for machine learning that emphasizes easy testing and deployability.

The goals are to create an easy to use tool that can aid in a lot of the pain points that surround creating and deploying machine learning algorithms, such as:

#. Scalability
#. Reusability
#. Deployment

Percept is open source under an AGPL license.
