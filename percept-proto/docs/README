This directory contains documentation that can be built into HTML using sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

Sphinx uses ReST (reStructuredText) as the source for its documentation files.

To create an HTML version of the docs:

* Install Sphinx (``pip install Sphinx``)

* In this directory, type ``make html`` (or ``make.bat html`` on
  Windows) at a shell prompt.

The documentation in _build/html/index.html can then be viewed in a web browser.
